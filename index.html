            <h3>Design and Modification of Propeller Shaft Generating Electricity</h3>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A vehicle such as a large truck can generate electricity for operating a hybrid engine or recharging batteries by use of an electricity-generating driveshaft. The electricity-generating driveshaft is comprised of a magnetized driveshaft acting as a rotor and a series of copper wire coils surrounding it acting as a stator in an electrical generator.</p>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> Designed and modified a propeller shaft to generate electricity, integrating a magnetized driveshaft with copper coils to produce 10-30V AC (converted to DC via an AC-DC converter) for hybrid vehicle applications. Utilized CATIA v5 for 3D modeling and performed design calculations for shaft diameter (20mm), torque, and power output (295.862W at 1440 RPM). Achieved voltage outputs from 14.2V at 710 RPM to 46V at 2770 RPM, enhancing engine efficiency by reducing alternator load.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills Learned:</strong> Mechanical Design, CATIA v5, Electromagnetic Induction, Generator Design, 3D Modeling, Team Collaboration</p>

            <h3>Conveyor Line Color Object Sorting</h3>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Designed an automated system using a monochrome camera, RGB filters, and colored LEDs to sort colored objects on a conveyor line, controlled by a PLC and integrated with a robotic arm for efficient industrial sorting.</p>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> Developed a machine vision system with a Sony XC-56 monochrome camera, enhanced by RGB filters (servo-controlled) and a 241-LED RGB disk, to detect red, green, and blue objects on a conveyor. An Allen-Bradley CompactLogix 5300 PLC managed the conveyor (stopped via beam sensors), FANUC LR Mate 200iC robot (with suction cup EOAT), and HMI (PanelView Plus) for user color selection. FANUC IRVision processed images, identifying colors via contrast and guiding the robot to remove non-matching parts. Achieved continuous sorting with minimal errors, though green-blue differentiation near conveyor edges required refinement. Presented at the 23rd Hawaii International Conference on Education, 2025.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Developed a control system using LabVIEW and Simulink to manipulate a stepper motor’s direction and speed based on light sensor inputs for precise automation applications.</p>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> Created two control systems: (1) In LabVIEW with ELVIS III, used a Vernier light sensor to control a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor’s direction (CW for increasing distance, CCW for decreasing, stop for stationary) at constant speed, updated every 2ms, with a GUI showing distance, direction, and position, plus a full/half-step switch. (2) In Simulink with NI PCI 6024E DAQ, adjusted motor speed (10-100 Hz, 2.93-29.3 RPM) based on light intensity (Lux), with a dashboard GUI displaying speed, RPM, and Lux trends. Both systems successfully interfaced sensor data with motor control, though position/speed tracking required recalibration.</p>
